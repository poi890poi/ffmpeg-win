Write Python codes with 2 files:
- layout.py to define layout with Pydantic.
- main.py to import layout.py and create a window using tkinter.

The main window contains two panels:
- Left panel has multiple buttons to switch content of the right panel.
- Right panel has a table with multiple rows.
(Like a tab control or pages)

Each row in the table of right panel could have either:
- File Selection: A button to browse for file and a label to show path of the selected file.
- Property Viewer: A vertically scrollable table to display properties of a file in the format of key/value pairs.
- Time Input: A label and a input filed to designate time. Could be a free text input field or a time control in the format of HH:MM:SS.
- Parameter Input: A label and a text input.
- Progress Bar: A button to act and a progress bar with graphics and text over the bar.
- Options: A label and a dropdown list to choose among pre-defined options.

The application have 3 tabs:
- File Inspection:
  Row 1: File Selection
  Row 2: Property Viewer
- Trim Audio:
  Row 1: File Selection
  Row 2: Time Input for start time
  Row 3: Time Input for duration
  Row 4: Progress Bar for trimming
- Loop Video:
  Row 1: File Selection
  Row 2: Time Input for duration
  Row 3: Progress Bar
- Combine AV:
  Row 1: File Selection for video
  Row 2: File Selection for audio
  Row 3: Options for audio codec: AAC, FLAC.
  Row 4: Options for sampling rate: 48 kHz, 96 kHz, 128 kHz.
  Row 5: Options for bit rate: 128k, 256k, 384k.
  Row 5: Progress Bar

Add a custom function "refresh_file_meta" that is called on file selection in tab File Inspection. I would like to add data to Property Viewer when a file is selected.
